# EpiBuilder-2
### _A Tool for Assembling, Searching, and Classifying B-Cell Epitopes_

### Features that you will have using EpiBuilder-2:
- Use your BepiPred3 predictions or FASTA files (new)
- Epitopes list (including FASTA)
- Build your epitopes by length (min, max) and score
- Search your epitopes in proteomes 
- Received several output files including XLSX (please explore the results)
- Biochemical features such as: 

| Method | Description |  Reference |
| ------ | ------ |  ------ |

## Input options
This version is adapted exclusively for Biolib, so the only CSV accepted here is the generated one by [BepiPred-3](https://biolib.com/DTU/BepiPred-3/)

| Type | Description |
| ------ | ------ |
| CSV | file generated by BepiPred-3 (raw_output.csv)|
| FASTA | FASTA file|

* BepiPred-3 presents a new score method (the default threshold is 0.1512, previously BepiPred 2.0 was ~0.5)
